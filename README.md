# har-grab-plugin

*note: currently this tool only supports chrome and chromium based browsers,*
*support for other browsers will be added later (likely firefox first)*

This is a simple chrome plugin meant to assist in automated testing with 
tools like selenium without having to deal with a proxy to get web traffic,
which can be a bit of a headache, particularly if you want to track websocket.

## How It Works
When I say simple, I do mean simple. It is a simple application of chrome's
`devtools.network` api that gets the HAR that is generated by chrome's devtools
panel. So, for this to function, devtools has to be open. More on that in the
usage instructions. After it gets the har, it puts it at `document.har` so it
can be accessed by any automated testing framework that has access to the
javascript console.

## Drawbacks
The har dump is triggered by a keyboard shortcut, meaning the browser must be
focused. Unfortunately selenium cannot send keystrokes at the browser level, and
chrome currently doesn't read selenium inputs as browser inputs, so something
like `java.awt.Robot`, Sikuli, or some equivalent system in python should be used.
This means the window will need to run with head on and be focused during the tests
